type

## 1. Where are you

How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?

Write the name of the function in the file, without ().

## 2. Right count

In the following code, do a and b point to the same object? Answer with Yes or No.

```
>>> a = 89
> >> b = 100
```

## 3. Right count =

```

## 16. Integer incrementation

What does this script print?

```

> >> n += 1
> >>
> >> a = 1
> >> increment(a)
> >> print(a)
```

## 17. List incrementation

What does this script print?

	def increment(n):
		n.append(4)
	
	l = [1, 2, 3]
	increment(l)
	print(l)

## 18. List assignation

What does this script print?

```
>>> def assign_value(n, v):
> >> n = v
> >>
> >> l1 = [1, 2, 3]
> >> l2 = [4, 5, 6]
> >> assign_value(l1, l2)
> >> print(l1)
```

## 19. Copy a list object

Write a function def copy_list(l): that returns a copy of a list.

## 20. Tuple or not?

Write a function def is_same_class(obj, a_class): that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False.

## 21. Tuple or not?

Write a function def is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class): that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.

## 22. Only sub class of

Write a function def inherits_from(obj, a_class): that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.

## 23. Same class or inherit from

Write a function def is_kind_of_class(obj, a_class): that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.
